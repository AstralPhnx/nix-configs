Personal Nix Config Files.

Please for the love of all that is holy do not actually use these for they are really janky and probably broken in some strange way
These are only public for the sake of linking them to people for feedback + shits and giggles

Note these configs are for my personal laptop device which is a ThinkPad T14 AMD Generation 1. 
If for some insane reason you wnat to use this config (why?) be aware that it is configured with hardware specific flakes (to stop me from going insane). But seriously don't use these.

Thx Love You Bye
